**PROJECT INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT:**
To provide context for this file, this project is being built as the final capstone project for the “Google Data Analytics Certification.” As a final piece of the certificate, it was time to showcase all of the content learned in the coursework in this case study. 

The data analysed in this project consists of various pieces of biometric data generated by a "smart" watch with fitness tracking capabilities. In this project, various  phases of the analysis processes were explored, including the initial look through of the data, formulation of questions to be answered by the data, and then the building and analysis of visualizations designed to answer those questions. This entire project is done using the R coding language.
